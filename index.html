<h3>History of dry fruits</h3>
<p>Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for 
millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up 
by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or
 dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree 
or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued
 them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness.
